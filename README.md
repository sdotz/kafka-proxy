# kafka-proxy

This is a layer 7/application level proxy for Kafka with pluggable middleware support. You can use
it to change client requests before they hit the broker, change responses from the broker being sent
to the client, or pass through requests/responses while making some side-effect like tracking
metrics or logs.
